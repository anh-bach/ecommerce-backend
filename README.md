# E-commerce Web Application with MERN Stack.

This is my little web application to practice React, Node, Express and MongoDB in the last summer. This simple application has authentication implemented from firebase with register, login (with Google and Facebook pop-up), forget-password, reset-password functionality.

## Front-end:

- React and Redux.
- Bootstrap and Ant Design.
- React Toastify package to make flexible notification.

## Back-end:

- Node and Express to build server.
- Firebase authentication.
- MongoDB and Mongoose for database.

## Deployment:

The app is deployed on Digital Ocean. You can check it out at: https://iamanh1990.github.io/Ecommerce-frontend/

You can register for a new user account and start exploring the app. There is admin dashboard for admin and normal dashboard for subscriber.

Stripe Checkout is implemented in the app. Check it out by using the following fake card number:

```
card-number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
CVC: Any 3 digits
DATE: Any future date
ZIP: 11111
```

You can try to login as admin with the following info to test CRUD operations:

```
email: quocanh1990bach@gmail
password: 123456789
```
